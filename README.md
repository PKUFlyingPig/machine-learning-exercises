codes for the exercises of Machine-Learning by ZhouZhihua

This winter holiday, I read the book Machine-Learning written by ZhouZhihua.  To practise my coding ability, I decided to realize those important algorithms by hand.

dataset:
watermelon_data.csv -- two classes, two properties

watermelon.csv -- two classes, eight properties

Logistic Regression

Logistic Regression with kernal

Back propagation algorithm in the fully connected neural network

Supporting vector machine 

To be continued
